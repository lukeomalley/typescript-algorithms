/**
 * Longest Common Subsequence
 *
 * Write a function that takes in two strings and returns their longest common
 * subsequence.
 *
 * A subsequence of a string is a set of characters that aren't necessarily adjacent
 * in the string but that are in the same order as they appear in the string. For
 * instance, the characters ["a", "b", "c"] form a subsequence of the string "abcd",
 * and so do the characters ["b", "d"]. Note that a single character in a string and
 * the string itself are both valid subsequences of the string.
 *
 * You can assume that there will only be one longest subsequence.
 *
 * Input: "ZXVVYZW", "XKYKZPW"
 * Output: ["X", "Y", "Z", "W"]
